# CogQA

CogQA is an introduction of a realistic dataset for cognitive-inclined Question Answering. The files contains modification of "WikiQA's test dataset", by addition some cognitive features. This dataset is free to use for research purposes, but do well to cite "WikiQA".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For simplicity and the sake of research, the data has been grouped:

1. CogQA_Test_Questions_With_No_Answers ----
2. CogQA_Test_Questions_With_Answers -------
3. CogQA_Test ------------------------------  
4. WikiQA_Test ----------------------------- test data used by Yang et al. in "WIKIQA: A Challenge Dataset for Open-Domain Question Answering".

Each of files 1, 2 and 3, has 
Col 1 --  Question
Col 2 --  Question's 1st cognitive category (cognitively ranked 1st)
Col 3 --  Question's 1st rank cognitive category's confidence score
Col 4 --  Question's 2nd cognitive category (congnitively ranked 2nd)
Col 5 --  Question's 2nd rank cognitive category's confidence score
Col 6 --  Question's conceptual information (cognitively ranked 1st)
Col 7 --  Question's 1st rank conceptual information's confidence score
Col 8 --  Question's conceptual information (cognitively ranked 2nd)
Col 9 --  Question's 2nd rank conceptual information's confidence score
Col 10 -- Question's entity (cognitively ranked 1st)
Col 11 -- Question's entity's confidence score
Col 12 -- Question's most vital keyword (cognitively ranked 1st)
Col 13 -- Question's most vital keyword's confidence score
Col 14 -- Candidate sentence
Col 15 -- Candidate sentence's 1st cognitive category (cognitively ranked 1st)
Col 16 -- Candidate sentence's 1st rank cognitive category's confidence score
Col 17 -- Candidate sentence's 2nd cognitive category (congnitively ranked 2nd)
Col 18 -- Candidate sentence's 2nd rank cognitive category's confidence score
Col 19 -- Candidate sentence's conceptual information (cognitively ranked 1st)
Col 20 -- Candidate sentence's 1st rank conceptual information's confidence score
Col 21 -- Candidate sentence's conceptual information (cognitively ranked 2nd)
Col 22 -- Candidate sentence's 2nd rank conceptual information's confidence score
Col 23 -- Candidate sentence's entity (cognitively ranked 1st)
Col 24 -- Candidate sentence's entity's confidence score
Col 25 -- Candidate sentence's most vital keyword (cognitively ranked 1st)
Col 26 -- Candidate sentence's most vital keyword's confidence score
